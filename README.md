# Bilkent EEE 212 Microprocessors Term Project: Signal Generator

<!-- Project Description -->
In this project, the FRDM-KL25Z development board was utilized in conjunction with the uVision5 development IDE. The objective was to generate three distinct waveforms directly within the board's hardware. A potentiometer was employed to modulate the amplitude of the generated waveform. The analog signal from the potentiometer was sampled using the internal ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) of the development board. Additionally, a button was implemented to facilitate the interchange between waveform modes, including square wave, sawtooth wave, and rectified sine wave.

In this project, we leveraged the capabilities of the FRDM-KL25Z development board in tandem with the uVision5 development IDE to create a signal generator. By incorporating a potentiometer, we were able to dynamically adjust the amplitude of the generated waveform, providing flexibility in signal output. The integration of the internal ADC allowed us to sample the analog signal from the potentiometer, enabling precise control over the waveform characteristics. Furthermore, the inclusion of a button facilitated seamless switching between different waveform modes, enhancing the versatility of the signal generator.
