Bilkent EEE 212 Microprocessors Term Project: Signal Generator
In this project, FRDM-KL25Z development board was used with uvision5 development IDE. In the project, three different waveforms were generated inside of the board. By using a potentiometer, the amplitude of the generated waveform was changed. Analog signal coming from the potentiometer was smapled with the internal ADC of the development board. A button waa used to interchnage between waveform modes: square wave, saw tooth wave and rectifiec sine wave.
