# Bilkent EEE 212 Microprocessors Term Project: Signal Generator

<!-- Project Description -->
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    <p>In this project, the FRDM-KL25Z development board was utilized in conjunction with the uVision5 development IDE. The objective was to generate three distinct waveforms directly within the board's hardware. A potentiometer was employed to modulate the amplitude of the generated waveform. The analog signal from the potentiometer was sampled using the internal ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) of the development board. Additionally, a button was implemented to facilitate the interchange between waveform modes, including square wave, sawtooth wave, and rectified sine wave.</p>
